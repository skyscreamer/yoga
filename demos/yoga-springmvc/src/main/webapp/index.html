    <h1>Yoga Demo</h1>
    <p>Congratulations, you have successfully deployed the Yoga demo!</p>
    <p>
        Yoga extends your existing REST implementation to create nested selectors that provide server-side
        navigation of the object tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project arose out of real-world issues that were not met by standard REST approaches:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Using hypertext navigation to retrieve related resources requires a sequence of HTTP requests. When mobile
            devices try to perform multiple requests to render a single screen, the user experience is SLOW.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some of a resource's data fields may be dynamic and expensive.  If they are rarely needed, they should not
            be returned every time the resource is requested.
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating or changing custom server calls creates a not-so-Agile
            dependency for the client developer and an unnecessary cost for the server-side REST programmer.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The Yoga approach is simple.  On top of your RESTful implementation, you can pass a selector which asks the
        server to return nested or non-default fields with the response.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, here is a traditional REST request that gets the information for a user:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="user/2.json">/user/2.json</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A mobile developer can create a very simple profile page with this data.  Let's say the designers want to
        display list of the user's favorite artists on the same profile page.  We add the selector
        as a parameter, like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="user/2.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists)">/user/2.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists)</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        You could take this yet a step further, and grab the discography for those artists to display some album
        information on the same screen:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="user/2.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists:(albums))">/user/2.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists:(albums))</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        ... OR maybe you are more social-graph focused, and you want to show the other users that like the same artists
        as this person.  You could do a circular reference back to the fans of that artist, and print out little icons
        for each one below the artist, filtering out the user from the profile page itself.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="user/2.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists:(fans))">/user/2.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists:(fans))</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Note that the circular reference does not continue to loop, since a selector has not been added to "fans".
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach also works with calls that return collections of resources. Here we retrieve a list of all users
        in the database, and their favorite artists.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="user.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists)">/user.json?selector=:(favoriteArtists:(albums))</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        We worked to make the code as simple as possible.  First you decide which fields you want to make your defaults,
        using the @Core annotation on corresponding like so:
    </p>
        <pre>
        <b>@Core</b>
        public long getId() {
            return id;
        }
        </pre>
    <p>
        This means that this field will always be returned regardless of the selector.  Then you create a convertor
        for the selector.  In spring it works like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;bean id="conversionService" class="org.springframework.format.support.FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean"&gt;
            &lt;property name="converters"&gt;
                &lt;set&gt;
                    &lt;bean class="org.skyscreamer.yoga.converter.SelectorConverter"/&gt;
                &lt;/set&gt;
            &lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;/bean&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>Or add the converter to an existing formatting conversion service.  Tell your controller how to read
    the selector, then simply pass it with your return object to Yoga's default simple response mapper:</p>
    <pre>
        @Autowired protected ObjectFieldPopulator _objectFieldPopulator;

        @RequestMapping("/user/{userId}")
        public void getUser(@PathVariable long userId, <b>@RequestParam(required = false) Selector selector</b>, ModelMap model) {
            User user = _userDao.findByPrimaryKey(userId);
            Map&lt;String, Object&gt; objectTree = <b>_objectFieldPopulator.populate( user, selector );</b>
            model.put("response", objectTree);
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Remember you'll still need to wire up a serialization mapper like Jackson to convert the model objects into
        JSON.  You can look in the <a href="http://github.com/skyscreamer/yoga-demo">yoga-demo</a> source code for an
        example of how to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        The response will navigate only along the lines identified by the selector.  If you are mapping a JPA entity
        with lazy collection mappings, those mappings will only be invoked if the selector requests them.  You can
        wire anything you want to a getXXX() pattern, and it will be a selectable field.  If more complicated DTO
        marshalling logic is needed, you can create custom data populators by extending <b>AbstractFieldPopulator</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, here's an example of a deep-dive query that would take a dozen queries in a traditional RESTful API.
        It returns a list of all the songs by my friends' favorite artists:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="user/1.json?selector=:(friends:(favoriteArtists:(albums:(songs))))">/user/1.json?selector=:(friends:(favoriteArtists:(albums:(songs))))</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create an aliasing system to allow dynamic aliasing of selector-based queries into more RESTful
                calls. (e.g. The last call could become "/users/favoriteArtists/2.json".)  The raw selector framework
                can be disabled in production to ensure that queries are approved and configured for response caching.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simplify integration with any existing REST framework.  The first demo application is done on Spring
                MVC, but there is no reason the code would need to depend on a particular implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add security hooks.  Allow field level security to limit the data that is accessible by the framework.
                A white-list approach to selector fields would prevent inadvertently exposing unwanted fields to 3rd
                parties.  This would also lend itself to enterprise SOA architectures where data needs to be more
                tightly controlled.
            </li>
        </ul>
